> Here lies my assignments for course [_Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting).
> There were 3 assignments based on using Python and its libraries for data visualization.

## Assignment 2
The data for this assignment comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Daily Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt) (GHCN-Daily)

The goal of this assignment was to "*write some python code which returns a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day should be shaded. Overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.*"

Firstly data cleaning was done. Next I found all temperature records for given period of time and which of them were beaten in 2015. After that I had all data needed for visualization and plotted it.

In result I got this plot.

## Assignment 3
This assignment is called ***Building a Custom Visualization*** and based on building bar chart using matplotlib library.

Bar chart was built in next way: "*a color scale with only three colors, (e.g. blue, white, and red). Assume the user provides the y axis value of interest as a parameter or variable.*"

Data was generated by NumPy library.

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(12345)

df = pd.DataFrame([np.random.normal(32000,200000,3650), 
                   np.random.normal(43000,100000,3650), 
                   np.random.normal(43500,140000,3650), 
                   np.random.normal(48000,70000,3650)], 
                  index=[1992,1993,1994,1995])
```

In result I got this plot.

## Assignment 4
This assignment is based on analysis two datasets and preparing the visualization.

**Question which I studied**: How have the win percentages for the best teams of Southwest and Southeast NBA Divisions (San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat) change since these Divisions were created?

Data, which I used, was taken from Wikipedia for [Miami Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Miami_Heat_seasons) and [San Antonio Spurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_San_Antonio_Spurs_seasons) and written into Excel files for easier reading.

In result I got this plot.
